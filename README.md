# foundations-landing-page

This is a project in the Foundations course of The Odin Project. This project sits at the end of the Basics of HTML and CSS, and serves as a challenge to put into practice all that I have learnt so far. The assignment is to recreate a simple landing page with pure HTML and CSS.
